    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we present a brief overview of the main functionalities of the `spreg` library in PySAL. `spreg` (short for spatial regression) supports the estimation of classic and spatial regression models. Currently, it contains methods for estimating standard and spatial versions of models such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS), Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR), and Random and Fixed effects panels. Additionally, it offers various tests of homoskedasticity, normality, spatial randomness, different types of spatial autocorrelation, and tools for the generation of random spatial data and model specification search. It addresses spatial heterogeneity through spatial regimes regression with both exogenous and endogenous determination of the regimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we will focus exclusively on spatial dependence and cover the following:\n",
    "1. Basic Data Management\n",
    "2. OLS with Spatial Diagnostics\n",
    "3. Specification Search\n",
    "4. The SLX model\n",
    "5. Spatial Lag and Spatial Durbin models \n",
    "6. Spatial Impacts\n",

    "The regression output is augmented with a section at the bottom, entitled DIAGNOSTICS FOR SPATIAL DEPENDENCE. It is organized into two parts, one dealing the SAR-Error model as the alternative specification, the other with the Spatial Durbin specification (SDM). The *robust* LM tests are only robust to one of the other two possible alternatives. For example, the robust LM-Lag test in the SAR-Error part is robust to the presence of error autocorrelation, but not to a possible misspecification in the form of SLX. In contrast, the robust LM-Lag test in the Spatial Durbin part is robust to the presence of an SLX term, but not to spatial error autocorrelation. As Koley and Bera (2023) have shown, it is not possible to develop a test statistic that is robust to both other forms of misspecification, due to the lack of identification of the parameters in the GNS model. They refer to this as the *two out of three* problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAR-Error part shows Moran's I, the LM tests and their associated robust forms, first for Lag and then for Error. The standardized z-value for Moran's I is 6.521 and highly significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LM-Lag test (26.211) is highly significant, but its robust form (0.258) is not. In contrast, both LM-Error (39.569) and the associated robust form (13.615) are highly significant, suggesting an Error alternative. Finally, the joint test for Lag and Error is highly significant as well. This test is not always indicative of the need for a higher order alternative, since it has high power against the single alternatives as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The upshot of these statistics is strong evidence towards a spatial error alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final set of tests are the LM tests in a Spatial Durbin context. The LM test for the coefficients of WX is given first, with its robust counterpart. The degrees of freedom (DF, 2) match the number of explanatory variables (not counting the constant term). It this example, the LM test of 0.836 is not significant, but its robust counterpart of 14.193 is (robust to the presence of a spatial lag). The LM test for Lag has the same value as in the SAR-Error context (26.211), but its robust form (39.569) is now robust to the presence of an SLX term and is highly significant. The joint test for Spatial Durbin (40.404) has degrees of freedom equal to the number of explanatory variables + 1, or 3 in this case. It is highly significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Koley and Bera (2024) suggest the following interpretation of these results. First, consider whether the joint test is significant, which it clearly is. Then consider each of the robust forms of the test statistic, which are also both highly significant in this example. This would point to a Spatial Durbin alternative. However, there may be some other misspecifications going on here, since the values of the robust tests are *larger* than their original counterparts, which is not standard behavior. In a strict sense, the robust tests are robust to *small* departures from the null and they should be *smaller* than the original test, since they *correct* for the ignored misspecification. When this inequality does not hold, there is an indication that the misspecification is more major than the correction is able to accommodate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, the recommendations given by the SAR-Error and the Spatial Durbin contexts are at odds. "

In the SAR-Error context, Moran's I is still significant, but much less so than before. The LM-Lag statistic is also still significant, but its robust form is not. There is now only the weakest of evidence for the Error case (5.705 with a p-value of 0.02). Neither of the robust tests are significant.

There is strong evidence for an SLX alternative.

The robust Lag test (5.705) is no longer significant for a p-value of 0.01 (p=0169), whereas the robust WX test (17.742) is still highly significant (p=0.0005).

In addition, the `slx_vars` argument allows for a selective inclusion of $WX$ terms. This is useful when some coefficient estimates have the wrong sign or a magnitude that runs counter to the distance decay implied by Tobler's law. The spatially lagged explanatory variables can be created using both classic row-standardized weights, as well as kernel weights. The latter introduce of form of nonlinearity in the spatial averaging.\n",

The coefficient for **W_HIS_ct** is significant and larger than that of **HIS_ct**, while the latter is not significant at p = 0.01. In other words, the interpretation of these results in terms of distance decay and Tobler's law may be a bit problematic.\n",

    "The inclusion of the lagged explanatory variables has quite an effect, even though only **W_EP_NOHSDP** turns out to be significant of the four SLX terms. Also, the spatial autoregressive coefficient (0.509) is no longer significant. Three of the four lag coefficients (including the non-significant ones) have a negative sign, the opposite of the original regression coefficients. This raises the suspicion that the proper specification may be a spatial error model. The results of the Common Factory Hypothesis Test bear this out. At 4.083, it is *not* significant, which means that the common factor constraint can *not* be rejected. However, given the lack of significance of the spatial lag terms, this needs to be interpreted with caution. A better strategy would be to consider further refinements of the model specification by eliminating some lag terms by means of `slx_vars`, as in the SLX model. Specifically, since only **W_EP_NOHSDP** turned out to be significant, `slx_vars` is set to `[True, False, False, False]`"

The main difference is that what they refer to as *direct* effect also includes some feedbacks as reflected in the diagonal elements of the inverse matris. As a result, in their approach, the direct effects will differ from the estimates for $\\beta$. \n",

The $ATI$ is the average of all the elements of the matrix, or, $ATI = (1/n) \\sum_i \\sum_j (I - \\rho W)^{-1}$.

    "The listing of **SPATIAL LAG MODEL IMPACTS** for the `simple` and `full` methods clearly illustrates the slight differences between the two approaches. The **Total** effect is the same for both, but the distribution of the effect between **Direct** and **Indirect** is slightly different. For the `simple` method, the **Direct** effects are identical to the coefficient estimates, but for the `full` method, they are slightly larger. This is due to the use of the diagonal elements of the inverse matrix, rather than the original estimates. As a result, some of the spillover feed-back effects are characterized as **Direct**. As a consequence, the part attributed to the **Indirect** effect is larger for the `simple` method than for the `full` method.\n",

In part, this can be explained by recognizing that the SLX model is a truncated form of the reduced form for the spatial lag specification, i.e., only the first order contiguity elements from the reduced form are included. When ignoring the remainder, its impact tends to be attributed to the coefficients of $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$."

In order to get the total effect, this factor needs to be multiplied by both $\\beta$ and the matching $\\gamma$. However, there is an important difference in the way the direct effect is computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Kim et al approach, the direct effect is the coefficient of $\\beta$. This is a strict interpretation of direct effect, i.e., it considers the effect of $\\gamma$ to be indirect. This is consistent with the interpretation of $\\gamma$ in the SLX model, but it is not the approach used by LeSage-Pace in their original treatment. In their formulation, the $ADI$ is applied to both $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ to compute the direct effect, typically yielding a larger value for the direct effect (as long as $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ have the same sign). This approach is *not* followed by `spreg`. Instead, the direct effect is obtained by multiplying the $ADI$ with the $\\beta$ coefficient only. As a result, the share attributed to the indirect impact will be larger than in original the LeSage-Pace formulation (in contrast, the latter is followed in the `R` `spatialreg` package)."

    "With $\\rho = 0.50924$ as obtained here, the total multiplier follows as $2.038$. The total impact for the variable **EP_LIMENG** (ignoring for now that **W_LIMENG** turned out to be non-significant) would be $2.038 \\times 0.37091 + 2.038 \\times -0.04292 = 0.6683$, the value given in the **Total** column of the impacts listing. As in the lag model, the total impact is the same for the Kim et al approach and the LeSage-Pace approach. The main difference is in the way the direct effect is computed, which results in a different allocation between direct and indirect effects for the two approaches.\n",

    "The total and direct/indirect impacts can be compared to those suggested by the simple spatial lag model and the SLX model. For example, for **EP_LIMENG**, the total impact of a uniform change in that variable was 0.606 in SLX, 0.5061 in the spatial lag model and 0.6683 in the spatial Durbin specification. Of this (using the Kim et al logic), 0.220 was spatial spillover (indirect effect) in SLX, 0.1908 in spatial lag, and 0.2974 in the spatial Durbin model.\n",

    "As mentioned above, these impact measures are only summaries. A more meaningful indication of spatial spillovers would follow from a non-uniform change in (some of) the X variables through the use of the full reduced form. In addition, the average may mask some interesting spatial patterns. The `spreg.sputils` module contains the function `i_multipliers` that provides this detail."

    "## What we did not cover\n",

    "Due to time constraints, it is impossible to cover the full range of functionality contained in the `spreg` package in this workshop. Some important aspects that we did not cover include the estimation of spatial error models (both ML and GMM), and the estimation of higher order models. The latter are implemented as special cases of `spreg.GMM_Error` (the generic spatial error estimation) by including a spatially lagged dependent variable through the argument `add_wy = True`. As mentioned in the introduction, there is also functionality to carry out spatial diagnostics in a probit model, and to implement various forms of spatial regimes regression. So far, panel data functionality is limited to spatial seemingly unrelated regression and spatial lag and error fixed effects. New functionality continues to be added."
